# CastModelViewer (The Rust Edition)

CastModelViewer is a WIP, Rust-based tool for viewing and previewing `.cast` model files. It is a full rewrite of the original [CastModelViewer](https://github.com/echo000/CastModelViewer/tree/old-csharp) using [@dtzxporter/porter-lib](https://github.com/dtzxporter/porter-lib) for cross-platform model parsing and rendering.
